\section {Affiliation Pages}

We'd like to add a new series of pages to show affiliation information to users. Since we didn't do any previous work about affiliation information in the previous labs except that the affiliation table was input into the database, we have to write new SQL commands in search of affiliation information, and echo them out on the pages. The paper table and charts on other pages can be of help in showing the affiliation related information. Also, we have already got the author table written in the paper information page. Generally speaking, the work here is to collect the affiliation data and arrange them in order on the pages.


\subsection {General Description}

The final version of the affiliation section include 3 concrete pages. On the affiliation\_info.php page, we will give three numbers on top of the page, counting all the authors, papers, and references in the affiliation. Then the authors in the affiliation will be listed below, together with their own affiliation information (hyper-links included) and number of publications. Affiliation\_paper.php shows all the papers related to the affiliation. The affiliation\_charts.php, where three charts are displayed, will be reported in detail in the Statistical Graph Section.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{img/zlt_aff_demo1.png}
\caption{affiliation\_info.php page}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{img/zlt_aff_demo2.png}
\caption{affiliation\_paper.php page}
\end{figure}

In fact, for the same function to be displayed on the page, we did two versions of code to implement them. The first one was very basic, just like those in the paper/author/search pages. However, since all the affiliation data are selected from the big paper\_author\_affiliation table, the first version didn't perform well in loading speed. Our optimization will be introduced in the Optimization Chapter.



\subsection {Total Counts}
On top of every affiliation page, we've counted all the authors, papers and references concerned. For authors and papers, we can directly count them in the paper\_author\_affiliation table. For references, we first select the papers and then join the selected results to the paper\_reference table in order to count the results. The MySQL commands are listed below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_aff_authorcount.png}
\caption{Count Author Commands}
\label{fig:aff_authorcount}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_aff_refcount.png}
\caption{Count Reference Commands}
\label{fig:aff_refcount}
\end{figure}

Note that we've use some MySQL techniques such as DISTINCT (eliminate overlapping results) and GROUP BY (perform data counting job) in order to implement our function.

For the data display in our page, our template has already provided a well designed data container in CSS, which can list different numbers in a row, with even width. We can simply apply this pre-defined class in a way demonstrated below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{img/zlt_aff_countdisplay.png}
\caption{Use Pre-defined Class to Display Numbers}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Authors List}

The author we've found based on the given affiliaiton may have more than one affiliation where he publishes his paper. So one simple search work is not enough. Luckily, all of the data related to this problem can be selected from the paper\_author\_affiliation table. As a result, our first design is to first sort out all the authors where the affiliation column fits, then we search the table again for affiliation information based on the author's id, which can be realized by looping through the author array in PHP.

In fact, the first step has been done when we count the authors (See Figure \ref{fig:aff_authorcount}), so we simply skip the first step, call the author selecting result in the counting section, and make further searching based on the previous result. During the second step, we've also used DISTINCT \& GROUP BY techniques in order to get the author's affiliation data right and unrepeated.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_aff_authorloop.png}
\caption{Use Loop to List Author\_Affiliation Information}
\end{figure}

The problem with this solution is that the searching work is too much. Imagine there are 100 authors related to one affiliation, we have to go through the big paper\_author\_affiliation table 100 times in order to get all the data. It turned out that it would take the webpage about half a minute to get completed loaded. The optimization work will be introduced in the Optimization Chapter.

\subsection{Papers List}

The general structure of this list is simlilar to those in citation/ reference/ author's paper list. We may just use MySQL to select all the paper's id related to the affiliation, keep this array storing the paperid we want to display, and the leave the rest of the work to the codes we've already written in the previous work. The selecting MySQL commands are listed below. Actually, just like the case in the author list section, the first step has also been completed in the counting section. (See Figure \ref{fig:aff_papercount}) So there are no codes left for this section to explain.

\section{Version II: by jQuery}



\chapter {Integrated Searching Bar}

We use the copy field in solr to realize an integrated searching bar. By making copies of fields to one field, we can apply several distinct field types to a single piece of incoming information.
\par To construct a copy field, we first add a new field, for example a field 'keyword'. Then we choose ¡®keyword¡¯ as destination and 'AuthorName', 'ConferenceName' and 'PaperName' as sources. Now, a query to 'keyword' can search all related information in three fields. In this way, we only need one integrated searching bar and do the query for one time to get all reults.


\chapter {Data Visualization}


\section {Statistical Graph}
In our website, we have 12 charts made by echarts altogether to visualize the data in the form of 3D histogram, pie chart, line chart and bar chart.

\subsection {3D histogram}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/fsh_3d_hist.jpg}
\caption{3D chart in the homepage}
\end{figure}

In the homepage, we have a 3D chart to show the publication tendency of every conferences. This is a static chart that we prepare the data in advance. To construct a 3D chart in echarts, we need an array that concludes three-dimension coordinates. The z-axis value refers to the publication.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/fsh_code_1.jpg}
\caption{Get data form Mysql}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Bar chart, pie chart and line chart}

The codes are similar when we construct a bar chart, pie chart or line chart. We need two arrays to show the x-axis coordinates and their values. We first get the data from Mysql database and then convert the php array to javascript. SQL languages 'GROUP BY' and 'count(*)' are massively used to get the data.
\par The following three charts come from conference page, search page and author page respectively. All codes related to these charts are in file 'pages/XX/XX\_charts.php'.
\par It's worth mentioning that to make all charts intelligible, we need to adjust the parameters in echarts option. For example, we set 'yAxis.minInterval: 1' so that decimal won't appear in y-axis labels. Also, we set 'xAxis.axisLabel.rotate: 40' so that all labels can all labels can be displayed(See Figure \ref{fig:bar chart example}).

\section {Paper Relation Graph}

A relation graph can visually reveal the relationship between papers, which we believe will be of great help to the users. For every paper, we've prepared a relation graph to show its reference papers, and the reference papers of its reference papers. Visitors can have a clear picture of how the paper is derived by looking at multiple levels of reference papers.

\subsection{Description}

We've applied a built-in template in echarts when making the relation graph. First we've fetched all the paper\_reference relationship concerned, including multiple levels of reference relations, from the database. Then based on these data, we translate them into two arrays, namely nodes and links, which can be accepted by the echarts template. In the meantime, we add more information such as paper title, weight of the nodes and styles of the links into the array. Then the relation chart can be generated by echarts. In addition, we also wrote a jQuery function by ourselves in order to allow our users to visit the cited paper directly by clicking the nodes or the links. Some demo screenshots are listed below.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/zlt_rel_demo2.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/zlt_rel_demo3.png}
\caption{Multiple Display Modes \& functions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Collect the Data}

For convenience's sake, we first wrote a function in order to integrate the search of a paper's name into a function call. The ucwords() is a useful function in PHP, which can turn the first letter of every word into upper case. This can give our information display a better look.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_rel_code_func.png}
\caption{get\_paper\_name function}
\end{figure}

Then we use MySQL to get the direct reference of the paper. For these referenceIDs, we wrote a loop to add them to the nodes array, and put these first-level relations directly into the links array.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_rel_code_lev1.png}
\caption{First Level Data Collection}
\end{figure}

After that, we wrote a nested loop. The first level is to loop through the depth (i.e. the reference level), the second level is to loop through reference papers of the last reference item. The searching structure is just like building a tree. Note that we've created a helping array storing the paperids that we've already added into the nodes array, so that we can avoid overlapping nodes. Theoretically, the reference level (depth) can be streatched to infinity, but for practical use, we assume the depth of 4 will be fine.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_rel_code_lev2.png}
\caption{Higher-Level Data Collection}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Set Echarts Options}

The links and nodes arrays we've created above are just what the built-in echarts template requires. However, the initial graph configurations were not suitable for our information. (See Figure \ref{fig:rel_contrast}) We need to block the display of node ids and loosen the distance between dinstinct nodes. After some manual regulating work, we make the graph look a lot better. Our major configuration codes are listed below.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_rel_code_config.png}
\caption{Echarts Options Configuration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Node Labels}

The labels of our nodes should show the paper's name and the labels of our links should show the name of the two papers in the reference relation. This work has already been finished when we are collecting the data. We set the label of the nodes to be exactly what we want to show to our users. A further step we took is to add hyper-links to every nodes and edges. Note that the name of every node is its PaperID, which can be directly applied to the URL, while the name of every link is composed of the reference node and the origin node. We use the string carving function in PHP to get the first 8 character, representing the reference node, so users can access the reference page by clicking the links.

\chapter {Beautify the Pages}

\section {Index Beautification}

There are altogether four parts in the index page: the top banner, the search box part, a chart and the bottom banner. The introduction of the chart is in the data visualization chapter.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/fsh_index.jpg}
\caption{The index page}
\end{figure}

\subsection {Top banner}

In the top banner, we have our website's name 'Smart Boy' and two buttons, 'search' and 'chart'. By clicking the button, the page will jump to the search part or the chart part.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{img/fsh_index_tp.jpg}
\caption{The top banner in index page}
\end{figure}

We use 'navbar' in bootstrap to complete out top banner. The links of 'search' and 'chart' are written in the nav tag(See in Figure \ref{fsh code 1}).

\chapter {MySQL Optimization in Affiliation Pages}

The affiliation section is a section all made by ourselves. However, as has been briefly introduced in the Affiliation Pages section, new problems arise that the loading speed is too slow. This is because in our solution, the big paper\_author\_affiliation table will be searched everytime we display a new row in the webpage, which is clearly unnecessary. (See Figure \ref{fig:opt_basic})
{}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/zlt_opt_code_basic.png}
\caption{Base Version in Affiliation Pages}
\label{fig:opt_basic}
\end{figure}


\section {Solution}
Through practice, we found that the main factor dragging the loading time slow is the call by PHP for MySQL query. In order to reduce the loading time, we need to control the time we call a MySQL query. However, generally speaking, since we first need to get the authors based on the affiliation\_id, and then find the detail information based on the author we have found in the first query, there is an unavoidable iterating structure in the process. The solution to this problem is not as easy as we assumed.

Eventually, we came up with the idea that all the searching work with MySQL can be integrated into one query. And we may just select the information we need from the total query results in order to display the information in the pages. This solution has restricted the searching query call to one single time. However, this will creat some difficulty when we want to echo the information onto the webpage.

\section {Integrated MySQL Query in Authors List}

Instead of searching the author information piece by piece, the searching query we write (See Figure \ref{fig:opt_query}) will return a group of rows showing the paper / affiliation information about one single author.

The basic idea about this integrated query is join the paper\_author\_affiliation table to itself, with restricting conditions of course. Our final result is a simplified paper\_author\_affiliation table, containing the author directly linked to the affiliaiton and the papers which might not be published in this affiliation, but whose authors once belonged to the affiliation. With the GROUP BY technique, the rows of every author can be returned group by group.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_opt_code_query.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/zlt_opt_code_queryres.png}
\caption{Integrated MySQL Query}
\label{fig:opt_query}
\end{figure}

\section{Echoing Tricks in Authors List}

Unlike what we did in the base version, where MySQL queries and PHP iterative loops are mixed together in an intuitive structure, here we are looping through the rows in the integrated searching results. (See Figure \ref{fig:opt_query}) So in every loop, we need to first judge whether this row is talking about the same author above or it starts a new one. Within the group corresponding to the same author, we just add one more affiliation into the webpage (before that we have to judge whether the affiliation is a new one, of course). While if the row marked the start of a new author, we have to end the previous row, begin a new row on the webpage. These tricks contribute to the whole author list, the final display on the webpage is just the same as the base version, but boasts a loading time within a second. The main part of the codes are listed below. (Initialization and Clean-up work omitted) The same tricks also apply to Paper List on the affiliation\_paper page.

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/zlt_opt_code_advanced.png}
\caption{Echoing Tricks}
\end{figure}

\section{Integrated MySQL Query in Top Authors Charts}

As has been discussed before in the Charts section, the top author charts require a list of author names and a list of numbers representing their publications counts. The same problem occurs that the data collecting work was taking too much time. We are also using MySQL joint search to replace PHP loops. We use count (DISTINCT ) + GROUP BY commands to directly get the result. The MySQL queries are listed below. Further processing on the searching results are fragile and hence omitted.

\begin{figure}[H]

All the three parts introduced above make up our optimization of the affiliation section.
